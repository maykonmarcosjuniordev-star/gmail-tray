# Gmail-Tray

Minimal Gmail notifier, with tray-icon, unread counter, opening the gmail page on a browser (firefox).

It mostly uses [fetchmail](https://www.fetchmail.info) to search for new emails and notify you, so you the main credits go for it's creator

*   My main job was create an interface and set up the polling code, so that it checks for emails on terminal, notifies the user and update the unread emails count

Also, you must set it (fetchmail) up first for it to work

## Build from Source

> cd gmail-tray

> makepkg -fsirc

> sudo pacman -U gmail-tray-2.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst

## Setting up fetchmail:

*   Create an app password (you need to have 2-Factor Authentication)
    *   Go to: [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
    *   Type Gmail-Tray > Create
    *   Note it down
*   Edit the .fetchmailrc file (create it on your home folder)
    *   Make it like:
        *   # account 1
            poll imap.gmail.com with proto IMAP  
               user \<your gmail 1 here>@gmail.com password \<"Your App Password 1 between quotes">  
               ssl
            # account 2
            poll imap.gmail.com with proto IMAP  
               user \<your gmail 2 here>@gmail.com password \<"Your App Password 2 between quotes">  
               ssl
            

    Then:
        chmod 0600 ~/.fetchmailrc

## Enable service autostart

> systemctl --user enable --now gmail-tray.service

## Uninstall

> sudo pacman -Rns gmail-tray

Customizations  
The user config file is in ~/.config/gmail-tray/gmail-tray-configs.json

There, you can change:

*   The checking interval to run fetchmail,
*   The browser used to open gmail (to the one you like most),
*   The flags used to open the browser

```
 (like --new-tab, --safe-mode (to use without extensions and make it lighter), ...),
```

*   The path to the gmail-tray icon (to another icon perhaps),
*   The app's title,
*   And even the link to open (if you, for some reason, want to open an alternative page instead of gmail)
